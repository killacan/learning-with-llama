# Learning with Llama

Welcome to Learning with Llama! This website is designed to help you learn full stack web development from start to finish.

## Why
      
I put this website together so that information on full stack development could be provided
to everybody for free. I want to help people on their journey to becoming a developer, without
any content being locked behind a pay wall. 

The problem that I see with a lot of the free content (although fantastic) is that it does not do a good
job getting you from start to finish as a developer. People assume that you already know how to do things,
which can be frustrating. I want this to work so that you can have all the info you need to get to a 
beginner level. From there you can see example projects and further tutorials, knowing you have the 
knowledge you need to learn on your own. 

The problem I see with a lot of paid content is that it costs an arm and a leg, and after you 
complete the course, usually after at least a few months, the long process of finding a job
can take a toll on you. Depending on the requirements of the school or bootcamp, you might
be hanging out to dry.

Sometimes it can be difficult to know where to start, and how to do things in a step by step manner.
My goal here is to have all the information layed out, with fun example projects that build on each other.

My hope is that I will not have to write everything out myself, but just give enough info and link to other
free content or get some of the community to help out. 

This is just going to be a passion project of mine, and hopefully I can use it to augment my YouTube
and Twitch channels.
